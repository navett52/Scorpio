# Scorpio
Scorpio is going to be a 2D game engine with a focus on procedural open worlds written in C++. I want to develop it just as a learning experience. If it turns out to be something bigger, that'd be awesome. Chances are good that I won't actually start programming this for awhile.

A tee-shirt on the internet once said:
> Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.

and I don't plan to follow that.
