# Scorpio
Scorpio is going to be a multifunctional game engine. I want to develop it just as a learning experience. If it turns out to be something bigger, that'd be awesome. Right now I'll just be using the README for a list of features I want in the engine and for other planning purposes. Chances are good that I won't actually start programming this for awhile.

A tee-shirt on the internet once said:
> Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.

and I don't plan to follow that.

## Wanted Features
- Image Cycling
- Render 2D
- Render 3D
- Built in Git would be nice
